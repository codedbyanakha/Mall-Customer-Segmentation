# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
This project analyzes customer behavior using K-Means Clustering to segment mall customers based on age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify different customer groups to help businesses with targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset)

Features: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing: Loaded dataset, checked for null values & data types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Distribution plots for age, income, and spending score
   Count plots for gender comparison
   Violin & bar plots for insights
3. Clustering (K-Means):
   Found optimal clusters using Elbow Method
   Segmented customers into 5 clusters
   Visualized clusters using scatter plots

Insights
1. Young customers (18-30) tend to spend more.
2. High-income, low-spending customers need better engagement.
3. Low-income but high-spending customers existâ€”ideal for budget-friendly offers.

Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

This project will help businesses improve marketing strategies and customer targeting.
